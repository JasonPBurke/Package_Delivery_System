# Package_Delivery_System
This application finds an optimal shortest path given an excel file of packages and one of package dropoff locations.

This was my final project for my Data structures and Alogrithms II course.  It uses a greedy algorithm to find
a shortest delivery path for a given list of packages and delivery locations.  This takes into account 'special instructions'
for packages such as specific truck, delivery deadlines, incorrect addresses, delayed package arrivals, etc.

This utalizes hashtable and graph data structures, and is implemented using a greedy algorithm.
